# `cryptoz`

`cryptoz` is a library implementing cryptographic primitives in `zig`.

This project is intended to be educational, primarily to practically apply my cryptography studies and to a much lesser extend, learn zig.

Never use this in production, the code will be slower as I am focused on readability over performance and there's a high chance of bugs that will break security.
